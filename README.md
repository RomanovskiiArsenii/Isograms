# Isograms

An isogram is a word or phrase that has no repeating letters. In other words, all the letters in an isogram are unique; each letter appears only once in the word or phrase. Isograms are often used as a fun challenge or puzzle, and they are commonly found in word games and puzzles such as Scrabble, crossword puzzles, and anagrams. Examples of isograms include words like "desk," "jumpy," "dog," and "subway."
